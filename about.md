This website is an expression of me, so the best way to really find out is to
get a meta-analysis of my writings here, rather than hear my meta-analysis about
myself, nicely regurgitated for you. I have plenty of lenses and you can see the
list below. Consider them something of a disclaimer if you know how to filter
your input based on that information.

## Tl;dr (The "I am" section) ##

I am an internet nerd, Pathfinder (Dungeon's &amp; Dragons) nerd, computer nerd,
and lifehacking nerd. I am a Drupal and Ruby on Rails developer. I am in my
early 20's. I am gay and in a committed relationship. I ask a lot of questions
and do my best to find the answers. I have many other interests, but you're in
the tl;dr section anyway.
