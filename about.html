    <p>I have been in the fascinated by the internet since I was a teenager.
       When I was fifteen, I got the <em>XHTML, CSS, and Javascript (and PHP & MySQL) for Dummies</em> book and started hacking away.
       My small high school didn't have a website at the time and that seemed like the perfect first project.</p>

     <p>That was almost 10 years ago now.
        Now, I live in Tucson, AZ and the breadth of the technology that I implement has steadily increased since.
        I have been a full stack developer, capable of delivering complete solutions idependently or in a team, for the past four years.
        To the right are some of my current skills, but don't think of it as a complete list.
        If you want to know if I can solve a problem or augment your team with a different stack, the definitive way to find out is to contact me in some way.</p>
