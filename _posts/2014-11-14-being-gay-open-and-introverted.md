This time, I am here to talk to you about myself, or at least some of my intersectionalities 
and how they can make life difficult, or at least different. I don't want to talk to you about 
What it's like to be gay, open, or introverted separately, but together.

This is something I experience in my every day life. I have a partner in the fiancee stage and 
neither of us is in the femboy/twink/thin category. We are also very much into holding hands. We 
live in a very conservative state (Arizona), but in probably one of the most liberal cities in 
that state (Tucson). Trust me when I say there isn't a whole lot of competition. Nonetheless, 
we are both out and open about our love to everyone. Lastly, we are both introverted. Neither of 
us likes talking to strangers at random, epecially if we are the ones being approached. We like 
our quiet time and space and just enjoy each other's company. We buy our girl scout cookies each 
year, but we don't buy them in front of the grocery store, sorry scouts! Probably as a result of 
being introverted and some trauma in our past, we both have anxiety when it comes to 
confrontation.

Despite all of this, we are confronted by people on a regular basis. Two subjects often come up: 

1. **Our hair** is blue (me) and red (him) because we regularly use a semi-permanent dye.
   Sometimes, its a simple, "Nice hair!" which isn't too bad. We can and have dealt with those
   quite easily. Some people want to know which brand. Some people want to tell us the story of
   how they dyed their hair red one time, but since they have dark brown hair naturally, it 
   didn't turn out red. At that point, we're going a little too far, but at least they aren't
   trying to be confrontational. We dye our hair because we want to and we can, but we don't
   intend it to become a conversation starter every time we leave our residence.

2. **We're gay** is much more confrontational and what the rest of this post is about.

We know we're gay, we've checked. We make sure not to go grocery shopping at certain stores 
because the customers of those stores are not used to seeing gay people; we can tell. We have 
literally been stopped in the frozen foods isle so someone can tell us how brave we are being 
for holding hands in public. We understand the fight against discrimination and that our 
togetherness is a symbol of hope against those who don't believe we're human. Those interrupt 
our day, our putting groceries in the trunk, our trying on clothes at the mall. We are not 
the movement.

The worst ones are the people who don't look at our holding hands as a symbol of hope and 
support for equal rights, but as some twisted perversion of nature. They don't even have to 
say anything for us to see how they feel. The previous type of encounter is at least positive, 
but this one happens **way** more often. We can go for a walk at night and pedestrians on the 
sidewalk will just stare at us, or mumble something under their breath. This is where the 
confrontation anxiety really comes in. We're lucky that we don't have more vulnerable 
appearances. 

Is that going to make us stop holding hands and hide displays of affection that are more than 
perfectly reasonable for opposite-sex couples? Of course not. In a battle of looks, stares, 
and mumbles, at least we keep our symbol. Does it make us uncomfortable to hold hands in 
certain parts of the city, or times of the night? Of course it does.

You could say, 'well, at least you are getting recognized,' but that's not the point, is it? 
Equal rights is what we need, not classification. We don't deserve more attention as a cute 
gay couple than the cute straight couple in the same isle or the cute lesbian couple in the 
next isle over or the cute asexual person in the line to check out.

We have, on more than one occasion, seriously forgotten that we were gay. Not that our sexual 
preference changed, but that we forgot that's a label that we have to be aware of in society.
To us, wanting to hold hands as we go for our nightly walks is just normal. We are not the 
movement.
