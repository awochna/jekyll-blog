This is one of the major endeavors of my current position at the Mel and Enid
Zuckerman College of Public Health. Originally, the site ran on Drupal 6 with
a terrible page load time for logged-in users. Pages and functions were hacked
together with terrible bloat from unnecessary tags and pasting from Word. Some
built in functions were even built as custom modules.

All the content had to be ported over, including news article archives and old
research projects. This was done using the feeds and feeds tamper Drupal modules.
At the same time, the automatic import and controlled tampering with data gave
a unique opportunity to improve the fundamental objects being imported and
give them obvious relationships. For instance, a faculty member is clearly
related to the research projects they have.

Now, these relationships are known to Drupal and are exposed through views on
the different node templates using Panels. This required some advanced views
configuration that I did not understand prior to the start of the project.
This would be only one of a number of things I learned during the development
of this site.

I have not put an end date on this project yet because, although it is live,
there are still things we want to improve upon. The primary rounds of
development, however, ended in October 2014.
