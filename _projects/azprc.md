One of the first migrations I performed in my current position at the Mel
and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health. The old site was Drupal 6 and
I rebuilt it on Drupal 7. This project used an Omega 3 subtheme developed
at the University of Arizona to make brand compliance easier. This sped up
the development item required and allowed me to contribute on a
University-wide project with other developers from other departments.
