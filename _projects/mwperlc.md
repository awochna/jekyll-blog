The center's previous site was an almost unmaintained Drupal 6 site with
a boring theme. For this project, I met with the content manager who acted
as the customer and the middle-person between myself and the center. They
provided a print out of how they wanted their front page to look and some
direction as to it's desired behavior.

I tried to stay within those guidelines while also making my own suggestions
and maintaining university brand compliance. The center was very pleased
with the result. The above dates were for active development, this is a
site that I still maintain and update alongside the content manager.
